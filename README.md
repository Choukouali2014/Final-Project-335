# App Description:
For our web app final project we created a flag quiz game. Users are able to sign in and guess the country name that matches the flag displayed via multiple choice. There is a score for each game and  we update the most highest score to the data. We display all the scores of all users on the   leaderboard page. Morever, User can search for a country by name and just randomly view country. Some of the Technologies we used were, get bootstrap for the UI, Node, Express, and Mongo for the backend, and Rest Countries API for flag png and country name.
